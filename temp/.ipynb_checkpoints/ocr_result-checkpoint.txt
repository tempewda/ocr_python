DDE handwritten notes, week of Feb. 7th, 1954:

"Man's right to knowledge and the free use thereof."

An intriguing phrase -- it rings in the ears almost as if
we could hear Patrick Henry's immortal call to liberty or death. Merely
to claim this resounding slogan as our own gives us a feeling of
superiority over the demagogues, the jingoes, the tyrants who thrive in
the ignorance of others and employ curtains of iron or of oratory to deepen
and prolong that ignorance. We thrill ourselves by our own insistence on
academic freedom -- the teacher's right to knowledge and his privilege of
imparting his own interpretations thereof. We point with pride to
American schools from primary to graduate level and,comparing them
to institutions of learning in Prague, Budapest, and Moscow, we
emphasize the extent and scope of our freedoms and the enrichment of
human life deriving therefrom.

We are proud of our guarantees of freedom in thought and
speech and worship. Of such value are all these things to us that,
unconsciously, we are guilty of one of the greatest errors that ignorance
can make -- we assume that our standard of values is shared by all other
humans in the world,

We are not sufficiently informed.

Probably have more need for education than any other.
